        <h1> Geocache Description: </h1>
        <p>
        A short walk of about 1.5 km through an unspoilt piece of nature in Amsterdam-Noord.
        Like so many places, this area will one day fall prey to housing or industry, but for now we can still play outside here.
        Depending on the season and weather conditions, good footwear and long pants can come in handy.
        The cache can only be done on foot; So leave everything that has wheels or wheels behind at the starting point!
        </p>
        <p>
        There is sufficient parking space at the starting point N52 23.155 E004 56.817 ; use this too because from here it will be very difficult to drive .... you also have to answer the first question here: what is the most common number on the information board? grade = A.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP2 N52 23.221 E004 56.646 via how many tree trunks do you reach the other side here, number = B
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP3 N52 23.278 E004 56.614 no question here, just a landmark ....
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP4 N52 23.238 E004 56.516 From how many directions do paths converge here? number = C
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP5 N52 23.265 E004 56.476 here is a tree over the path; in how many parts was it sawn? number = D
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP6 N52 23,318 E004 56,548 how many tree trunks do you reach the other side here, number = E
        </p>
        
        <p>
        WP7 N52 23.242 E004 56.351 count the number of mooring posts ; this number times 16 = FG
        </p>
        
        <p>
        With the collected data you can now calculate the hiding place according to the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
        North 52 23. [AB] [G] [DE] East 004 56. [2 * E] [C + F] [F + G]
        </p>
